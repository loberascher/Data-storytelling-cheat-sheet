# Data-storytelling-cheat-sheet-for-Data-Analysts

Welcome!

The Data storytelling Cheat Sheet started as an university project during writing my thesis with the working title
"Data storytelling as a method to communicate big data to internal stakeholders".

This sheet is a PDF crammed with Data storytelling knowledge around best practices, tips and tricks. A practical guide you could say.
It's here to help you becoming better in the "art of storytelling".
The overall goal is to help you to boost your data storytelling skills.
You can help too! Any new ideas for the sheet? Make your contributions! 

This cheat sheet is specifically designed for people preparing and presenting data to internal stakeholders, so to people within the same organization.

May this cheet-sheet help you to better incorporate data storytelling in your job.

All the best,
Lisa, data storyteller in the making
