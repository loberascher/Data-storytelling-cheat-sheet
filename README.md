# Data-storytelling-cheat-sheet-for-Data-Analysts

Welcome!

I am Lisa, an alumna of the study program "Management, Communication & IT" at the "Management Center Innsbruck" in Tyrol, Austria.
The data storytelling cheat sheet is the result of my Bachelor thesis with the working title
"Data storytelling as a method to communicate big data to internal stakeholders".

This sheet is a PDF crammed with data storytelling knowledge around best practices, tips and tricks. A practical guide you could say.
The overall goal is to help you boost your data storytelling skills to become better in the "art of storytelling" within your job.
The source of knowledge put into this sheet comes from (1) an extensive literature research and (2) 13 interviews with data experts.

This cheat sheet is specifically designed for people preparing and presenting data to internal stakeholders.

May this cheet sheet help you to better incorporate data storytelling in your job.

All the best,
Lisa, data storyteller in the making
